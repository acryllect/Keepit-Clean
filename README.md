# Keepit-Clean
A simple, noob-friendly Discord bot to keep your chat clear from bot commands

## Requirements & Setup
**Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)!**

### Creating a new Discord Application
Head over to [the Discord developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and click "New Application".</br>
Ignore everything and go to the `Bot` section, in the sidebar. Once there, click "add bot". Next, go to the `OAuth2` section in the sidebar and select "Bot" as a scope and "Administrator" for permissions. Now copy the URL that has been generated just under `scopes` and paste it in your browser. You will be prompted to select a server in which you want the bot to be in.

### Bringing the bot to life
Download the source code (it really is just one file) from up top, right here, and open a terminal/CMD window.</br>
Open the folder inside the terminal (`cd /path/to/folder` on mac) and run `npm init`.</br>
Once the process is complete, run `npm install discord.js`. Your folder should now look like this: </br>

Next, open `index.js` in your text editor of choice and follow the instructions there (added as comments). </br>
- Note: your bot token is found under the "bot" section on the Discord developer portal. </br>

## But wait! There's more!
There is a shorter (but harder to understand) fork by [Nemdev](https://twitter.com/nemdev_) which you can check out [here](https://github.com/nashii-git/Keepit-Clean) if you're into efficiency and not a noob like me
